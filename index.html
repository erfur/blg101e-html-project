        <p>From its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour">wikipedia page</a>: 
        <blockquote>
            <b>Parkour</b> (French: [paʁkuʁ]) is a training discipline using movement that developed from military obstacle course training.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The aim is to get from one point to another in an environment in <i>the fastest</i> and <i>most efficient</i> way possible. Parkour includes following types of movement:
            <ul>
                <li>running</li>
                <li>climbing</li>
                <li>swinging</li>
                <li>vaulting</li>
                <li>jumping</li>
                <li>rolling</li>
                <li>crawling</li>
            </ul>
        and other movements as deemed most suitable for the situation.
        </p>

        <p>Parkour is an activity that can be practiced alone or with others and is usually carried out in urban spaces. It involves seeing the environment in a new way and imagining the potential for navigating it by movement around, across, through, over and under its features.</p>
